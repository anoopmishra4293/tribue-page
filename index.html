        <p id="tribute-info"> If we talk about scientific development specifically, there’s one name which comes to
            every mind — <strong>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</strong>.
            <br>
            <br>
            He was a renowned scientist in the field of Aerospace. During his career as a scientist, he proposed the
            then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman for the simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of
            taking planned missiles one after another. The cabinet allocated ₹388 crores for the mission, named the
            Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. The
            programme was aimed at enabling India attain self-sufficiency in the field of Missile Technology.
            <br>
            Dr. Kalam headed a Missile Study team to weigh the feasibility of the programme. The team included members
            from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the Army, Navy, Air Force and Defence
            Production. Keeping in mind the requirements of various types of missiles by the defence forces, the team
            recommended development of five missile systems. The ambitious, time-bound project brought together the
            country’s scientific community, academic institutions, industries and the three Services in giving shape to
            the indigenous strategic missile systems.
